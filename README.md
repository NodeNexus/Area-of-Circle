Area of a Circle in C
This repository contains a simple C program to calculate the area of a circle using the formula:

𝐴
=
𝜋
×
𝑟
2
A=π×r 
2
 
Where:

𝐴
A is the area of the circle.
𝜋
π (Pi) is approximately 3.14159.
𝑟
r is the radius of the circle.
Program Explanation
The C program prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle, then calculates the area using the formula above and displays the result.

Formula:
Area
=
𝜋
×
radius
2
Area=π×radius 
2
 
Features:
Takes user input for the radius of the circle.
Uses a constant value for Pi (
𝜋
≈
3.14159
π≈3.14159).
Outputs the computed area of the circle.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A C compiler like GCC or an IDE like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio.
